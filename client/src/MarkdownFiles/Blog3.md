If you are someone who doesn’t know how to use GitHub, then this blog is for you. Github is a web-based platform used for version control. Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects.

In this “how to use Github” blog, you will learn :
- How to create a GitHub Repository?
- Basics about Branches 
- First commit on github

These three are the most used operations in github among beginners. 

## 1. How to create a GitHub Repository?
A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub  or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, images or any kind of a file in a repository. 

After login with github, go to https://github.com/new

Now, if you noticed by default a GitHub repository is public which means that anyone can view the contents of this repository whereas in a private repository, you can choose who can view the content. Also, if you refer the above screenshot, initialize the repository with a README file. This file contains the description of the file and once you check this box, this will be the first file inside your repository.

Congratulations, your repository is successfully created! It will look like the below screenshot:

So now my central repository has been sucessfully created! Once this is done, you are ready to commit, pull, push and perform all the other operations. Now let’s move forward and understand branching in GitHub.

## 2. Basics about Branches 
Branches help you to work on different versions of a repository at one time. Let’s say you want to add a new feature (which is in the development phase), and you are afraid at the same time whether to make changes to your main project or not. This is where git branching comes to rescue. 

Branches allow you to move back and forth between the different states/versions of a project.

As a beginner, we will consider only one branch which is main. But having an idea of what branches is important. 

## 3. First commit on github
Commit basically means the changes that you make on your project and give a name to that change so that you can remember what changes you did. Try it with the readme file you have.

We have successfully made our first commit. I hope this blog gave you a basic feel about github, to learn how to connect github with your computer and commit from your system directly, I will link my next blog here.
